# ESP32 Micropython NEO-M8 GPS Driver #

### The Code: ###

This code reads data off of a UART pin on the ESP32. The Neo-M8 modules outputs NMEA sentences, which this code then converts into the useful data needed.

This code contains a modulesetup() method to configure the GPS module - this only needs to be run once per module, settings are saved into programmable flash (this will need to be change to Battery-Backed RAM for the NEO-M8M/M8Q).

As standard, the module updates its navigation fixes at a rate of 1Hz. This can be changed by calling the setrate() method, which takes two arguments: the first is the navigation solution update rate, while the second is the number of measurements per navigation solution. You can also call gnss_stop() and gnss_start() to stop/start the module's GNSS systems. gnss_stop() should be called before pulling the module's power, and these commands can also be used to reduce the module's power consumption when necessary. These methods may have different effects depending on the firmware version of your module.

To read data, you can call position(), velocity() or altitude() - which returns the relevant data, along with a timestamp. You can also call getdata(), which returns all the data returned individually by those methods.

To get faster GPS data reads, periodically call the update_buffer() method (takes very little time, call it without calling the main data processing methods). This simply loads data from the ESP32's UART RX buffer (defined as 128 bytes long, in this driver) into the driver's 512-byte sliding-window buffer of GPS data. This can reduce GPS data reads down to 0.002 seconds/read in my experiece, compared to 0.5-0.8 seconds/read when not calling the update_buffer() method regularly.

All position/altitude errors are returned to a 1Ïƒ confidence level (code assumes 1.5m HDOP and 5m VDOP).

If there are any issues with the data (i.e. the code can't process it), integer zeros will be returned for those values.

### Example Usage: ###

```python3
import gps_reading_data as gps

module = gps.GPSReceive(10, 9)
print(module.setrate(2, 3))

lat, long, position_error, time_stamp = module.position()
sog, cog, time_stamp = module.velocity()
alt, geo_sep, vertical_error, time_stamp = module.altitude()

lat, long, position_error, alt, vertical_error, sog, cog, geo_sep, timestamp = module.get_data()
```

To initialise the driver - the parameters the driver expects is the ESP32 pin that the GPS' TX pin is connected to, followed by the pin the GPS' RX pin is connected to. The above code is an example usage of the driver.

### Embedded C Module: ###

For higher performance, in the embedded_c_module folder you will find the .c, .h and .cmake files to compile the Neo-M8 driver into micropython firmware - there is a guide to compiling this below. 

This is currently still in development - the modulesetup() function is yet to be implemented.

Example usage:
```python3
from machine import UART
import NEO_M8

# NOTE: This embedded module requires the UART bus to be passed in - not TX/RX pin numers
bus = UART(2, baudrate=9600, tx=tx_pin, rx=rx_pin)
gps = neo_m8.NEO_M8(bus)

gps.setrate(2, 3)

print(gps.position())
print(gps.altitude())
print(gps.velocity())
print(gps.getdata())
```

### Compiling the module into firmware: ###

To do this, you will need:
 - ESP-IDF cloned from github
 - Micropython cloned from github

1. Enter your esp-idf directory, and run ./install.sh (only needs to be run the first time)
2. Enter your esp-idf directory and run . ./export.sh (needs to be run every new terminal session)
3. Download the files from embedded_c_module and place them in a directory of your choosing
4. Enter your directory ~/micropython/ports/esp32 (can be replaced with whichever micropython board you are using)
5. Run the make command, specifying USER_C_MODULES=/path/to/NEO-M8_GPS/embedded_c_module (replace with your file path)

For me, with an ESP32-S3 that has octal SPIRAM, the full make command is:
```
make BOARD=ESP32_GENERIC_S3 BOARD_VARIANT=SPIRAM_OCT USER_C_MODULES=/path/to/NEO-M8_GPS/embedded_c_module
```

### Settings the module is configured to: ###

 - VTG NMEA sentence disabled (contains redundant data)
 - Module set to airborne with <4g acceleration
 - 3D fixes only
 - Initial fix must be 3D
 - Satellites need to be 15 degrees above horizon to be used for a fix
 - Minimum satellites for navigation fix is 4
 - Maximum satellites for navigation fix is 50 (more than the module will realistically be able to see at any time)
 - Static hold at <20cm/s velocity and within 1m
 - AssistNow Autonomous enabled
     - Maximum AssistNow Autonomous orbit error is 20m
 - GNSS constellations enabled - Galileo, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, SBAS
 - Enabled interference detection
     - Broadband detection threshold is 7dB
     - Continuous wave detection threshold is 20dB
     - Active antenna
 - All the above configured settings saved into the module's programmable flash
